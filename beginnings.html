Michael Jeffery Jordan was born on February 17th, 1963 in Brooklyn, New York.
His family then moved to Wilmington, North Carolina when he was a small child.
Jordan attended Emsley A. Laney High School, in his sophomore year; he tried 
out for the Varsity basketball team, but never made the team; he was classed 
as too short, at 5’11”, to make the team – Jordan was sad, because he felt he 
was better than some of the other players. Motivated by this failure he trained 
extra hard – he even grew 4 inches, and eventually made the team the next year. 
The flames in Jordan never quenched – as he went on to score a bunch of 40 points games.
