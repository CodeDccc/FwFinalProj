Michael Jordan is one of a few athletes that can dunk by leaping from the free throw 
line. His high soaring abilities gave him the name ‘Air Jordan’. At times Jordan would
jump in the air before his opponent and remained in the air even after his opponent has 
jumped and landed – a manoeuvre they call ‘hang time’. His high flying, hanging ability
is what caused his brand to use the ‘flying man logo’.
