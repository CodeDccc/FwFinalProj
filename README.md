# FwFinalProj
Completed Project


My oxygen did not contain the necessary software packaging for me to create html file and so I had to go to help tab, then install new software, then I typed in this link - http://download.eclipse.org/releases/oxygen - Select web xml, then next and agree to the license, then you will be good to go.

Go to the website - start.spring.io to create a spring boot project and save the file to your pc, it will be saved as a jar file; you will have to extract it. Go to your java project, in my case – eclipse.  Afterwards, go to file, import, general, projects from folder or archive – then next, directory, computer and attain the saved spring boot file.

To create your first html page - Right click on static, create an html file and call it index because the home page has to be call index.
Afterwards, you can call your other html page(s) whatever you like.

Create a controller class – be sure to use the annotator ‘@controller’ so that java will handle it as such – this class will control the model view control (mvc) aspects of your program.

I had to use CSS to format the layout and fonts of my pages – this is a separate page on its own and it is without its own folder, which is in the static folder.

So my overall project if about some aspects of Michael Jordan’s life and at the end of the website, you have to pick a shoe and enter your shoe size to win a pair of Jordan’s.
