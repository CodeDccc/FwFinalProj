Michael Jordan won 6 NBA championship rings with the Chicago bulls. He won his first 
ring in 1991, after being in the league for 7 years. Jordan won his first 3 rings 
from 1991 – 1993, before retiring in the summer of 1993. He then went on the play
baseball for a view month, before returning to the National Basketball Association 
at the end of the 1995 season; however his skill level wasn’t as sharp as when he left, 
subsequently he and the bulls dropped out of the playoffs early. Over the summer of 1995, 
Michael Jordan made sure to put in all the practice, so that he can be ready for the 95/96 
NBA season. Jordan and his Chicago team came out of the gates like a raging bull, and they 
maintained this prowess throughout the season, in the end they sealed another title, earning 
Jordan his 4th ring. Jordan and the Bulls then went on to win 2 more rings – 97 and 98, making
it a total of 6 NBA titles in the 90’s before Jordan retired again. Jordan would return to the 
league a few years later playing for the Washington Wizards, a team he part owned at the time 
– all because of his love for the game. He did not have the same impact on the court as he did 
when he was younger, but he is still revered as the greatest of all time.
